Ah, well if it isn't the \n\
world famous Mario! You \n\
can call me Professor T. \n\
I'm what you could \n\
consider the owner of\n\
this manor. \n\
I wish I had time to sit\n\
around and chat - but as\n\
you can see things are\n\
not well. My manor has\n\
been sieged by ghosts, \n\
monsters of another realm.\n\
I was down in the basement\n\
working on my... research.\n\
That was when it happened.\n\
Before I knew it, these \n\
otherwordly creatures had\n\
taken over my lab, and -\n\
infested every part of the \n\
manor, stealing, distorting\n\
rooms, and creating holes \n\
in the very fabric of this\n\
world - though, I suppose \n\
you're familiar with that one.\n\
If I could just get into my\n\
lab I might be able to shut \n\
the portal that's letting \n\
them in - but there's just 1 \n\
small problem with that, the \n\
entrance to the basement - \n\
seems to be blocked by some\n\
sort of spectral barrier. \n\
The only lead I have is an \n\
especially high level of \n\
paranormal activity \n\
detected on the third floor.\n\
Do you think you could check\n\
it out for me? You'll first\n\
need to find the key to this\n\
door, which I believe I left\n\
in the Library. Here, I'll \n\
give you this, I call it the -\n\
Room Manager. \n\
